ver 0.3
-------
Warning: This is a work in progress things can change rapidly

1. Current support is for m4atags only
2. m4atags is dependent on AtomicParsley and mhash (both are bundled)
3. Building m4atags for the very first time:
   a) Type: make libs
   b) Type: make m4atags
4. m4atags is statically linked with the libs and has no execution dependencies
5. m4atags binary is located in the m4a directory
6. Design philosophy:
   a) No modifications to the existing Libraries (they are allowed to evolve)
   b) Self contained build - No other external dependencies
7. Options supported:
      m4atags --literal [ --with-md5sum | --with-sha1sum ] <m4afile>
      m4atags --verbose [ --with-md5sum | --with-sha1sum ] <m4afile>
      m4atags --help
8. This release uses the Original AtomicParsley 0.9 and not the bitbucket fork
9. Known Issues:
   a) Compiling atomicparsley generates a lot of Warning messages (Ignore)
   b) This was tested with a limited number of files (fetched from internet),
      any help in obtaining some non-contraband stuff would be more than welcome
